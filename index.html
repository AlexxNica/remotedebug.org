      <h2>The initiative.</h2>
      <p>RemoteDebug is an initiative to bring a common remote debugging protocol to today's browsers. It insn't a new phenomen. It has been around for years, but today each browser got their own, so we got:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chrome Remote Debugging Protocol.</li>
        <li>Opera Scope Transport Protocol (STP).</li>
        <li>Mozilla Remote Debugging Protocol.</li>
        <li>WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol (WIP).</li>
        <li>Microsoft BrowserLink.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each are incompatible, which means existing DevTools can't debug other browsers, and tooling implementor's need to spent a lot of time adding support for each protocol (and this means no-body does it).</p>
      <p>The vision for this intiative is to enable in-browser DevTools and editors to communicate and remote multiple-browsers. Imagine if it was possible to use Chrome DevTools to debug Firefox, or use Firefox DevTools to debug Chrome. What if you could debug your app in IE and Chrome directly from Sublime? When running your beautiful PhoneGab-app inside an embeded WebView, you should be able to use your favorite debugging tool, and not be forced you to use Weinre.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>We are building for the open web. Our tooling and protocols should be open too.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>The goal.</h2>
      <p>The long-term goal is to get all major browser vendors to implement and use the RemoteDebug protocol, but we know this is going to take some time, especially to get everyone on board, so the first step is to provide proxy-implementations for all major browsers.</p>
      <p>Once we get there, the next step is to get each browser vendor to implement RemoteDebug into their browser and their related DevTool.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The plan.</h2>
      <p>So how are we going to make this happen? Instead of starting from skretch, we propose to use the existing Chrome Remote debugging protocol as our starting point to define what we would call the "RemoteDebug protocol".</p>
      <p>The Chrome protocol is a great starting point as it's open and [well-documented](link) protocol. The protocol is used by Chromium-based browsers, which means we already have Chrome and Opera supported. In addition we also have a Webkit-protocol-to Chrome proxy implemented, which could be useful, as more proxies are going to be added over time.</p>

      <h2>Get involved.</h2>
      <p>There's a lot of work ahead, so we need your help. You can help us by spreading the word or by contributing to the projects. </p>
      <p>We need to make this happen. It's about time.</p>
